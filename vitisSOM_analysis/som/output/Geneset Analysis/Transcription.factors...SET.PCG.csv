"Vitvi01g00086","Vitvi01g00086","40 x 19","CabFra_warm_r3","Vitvi01g00086","An RNA polymerase complex containing polypeptides encoded by the plastid genome. Plastid-encoded DNA-directed RNA polymerases resemble eubacterial multisubunit RNA polymerases, with a core composed of alpha, beta, and beta-prime subunits. Some forms contain multiple additional subunits. An additional sigma factor subunit is required for promoter recognition."
