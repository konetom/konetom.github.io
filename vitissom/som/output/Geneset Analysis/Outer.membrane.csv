"Vitvi03g00848","Vitvi03g00848","32 x 22","Tocai_warm_r3","Vitvi03g00848","The import of proteins across the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes into the matrix. Unfolded proteins enter the mitochondrial matrix with a chaperone protein; the information required to target the precursor protein from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix is contained within its N-terminal matrix-targeting sequence. Translocation of precursors to the matrix occurs at the rare sites where the outer and inner membranes are close together."
