"Vitvi07g02591","Vitvi07g02591","29 x 8","Sangio_warm_r1","Vitvi07g02591","Binding to a metal ion."
"Vitvi06g01122","Vitvi06g01122","23 x 23","Riesl_acclim_r3","Vitvi06g01122","Catalysis of a biochemical reaction at physiological temperatures. In biologically catalyzed reactions, the reactants are known as substrates, and the catalysts are naturally occurring macromolecular substances known as enzymes. Enzymes possess specific binding sites for substrates, and are usually composed wholly or largely of protein, but RNA that has catalytic activity (ribozyme) is often also regarded as enzymatic."
"Vitvi06g01631","Vitvi06g01631","25 x 24","Chard_freeze_r2","Vitvi06g01631","Binding to ATP, adenosine 5'-triphosphate, a universally important coenzyme and enzyme regulator."
"Vitvi08g01917","Vitvi08g01917","5 x 34","Sangio_freeze_r2","Vitvi08g01917","The part of the cytoplasm that does not contain organelles but which does contain other particulate matter, such as protein complexes."
"Vitvi14g00478","Vitvi14g00478","24 x 24","Sangio_accfreeze_r1","Vitvi14g00478","Catalysis of the elimination of hydrogen sulfide or substituted H2S."
"Vitvi15g00761","Vitvi15g00761","22 x 20","Sangio_acclim_r2","Vitvi15g00761","A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent."
