"Vitvi05g00288","Vitvi05g00288","19 x 23","Chard_warm_r2","Vitvi05g00288","A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent."
"Vitvi07g00914","Vitvi07g00914","38 x 2","Riesl_warm_r2","Vitvi07g00914","Catalysis of the hydrolysis of a peptide bond. A peptide bond is a covalent bond formed when the carbon atom from the carboxyl group of one amino acid shares electrons with the nitrogen atom from the amino group of a second amino acid."
"Vitvi08g02106","Vitvi08g02106","27 x 8","Tocai_freeze_r2","Vitvi08g02106","A protein complex that catalyzes the deneddylation of proteins, including the cullin component of SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase; deneddylation increases the activity of cullin family ubiquitin ligases. The signalosome is involved in many regulatory process, including some which control development, in many species; also regulates photomorphogenesis in plants; in many species its subunits are highly similar to those of the proteasome."
